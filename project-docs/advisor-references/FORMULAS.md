# Formula Reference — Gap Tool

This document reflects the advisor-adherence methodology currently implemented in `src/features/risk-modules/` and the shared domain helpers under `src/domain/`.

The product is an illustrative gap-analysis tool. Output labels, formulas, and descriptions should avoid implying a formal recommendation.

## Shared planning assumptions

Source: `src/domain/assumptions/defaultAssumptions.ts`

```ts
incomeGrowthRate = 0.03
netIncomeRatio = 0.65
presentValueTiming = "endOfYear"
```

Present-value helper:

```ts
PV(stream) = Σ cashFlow[year] / (1 + annualRate)^(yearIndex + 1)
```

The first cash flow is discounted by one period. This is used only where a PV reference or capital-needs reference is explicitly shown.

# 1. Life Insurance

Primary files:

- `src/features/risk-modules/life/calculations/calculateIncomeGapScenarios.ts`
- `src/features/risk-modules/life/calculations/calculateLifeInsuranceGap.ts`
- `src/features/risk-modules/life/components/LifeInputForm.tsx`

## 1.1 Income replacement base

```ts
annualNetIncomeNeed = max(
  0,
  annualIncome × incomeReplacementRatio − spouseAnnualIncome
)
```

This is the modeled annual net income need before annual growth is applied. Life insurance death benefits are generally income-tax-free, so the benefit amount is not grossed down for taxes.

## 1.2 Projected annual net income need

```ts
projectedNetIncomeNeed[year] = annualNetIncomeNeed × (1 + incomeGrowthRate)^yearIndex
```

Default income growth is 3% annually.

## 1.3 Safe Income Coverage target

The old Safe Withdrawal Rate model has been replaced. The advisor-facing model now starts with a target income support percentage.

Default:

```ts
targetIncomeSupportPct = 0.85
```

Annual target stream:

```ts
targetIncomeNeed[year] = projectedNetIncomeNeed[year] × targetIncomeSupportPct
```

Total advisor-facing target death benefit need:

```ts
targetDeathBenefitNeed = Σ targetIncomeNeed[year]
```

This target is intentionally the main fully-covered threshold. It avoids the old behavior where a lower PV number could make the UI say “Fully Covered” while the advisor-facing death benefit need was still higher.

## 1.4 Entered coverage resources

```ts
coverageResources = groupLifeCoverage + privateLifeCoverage + nonQualifiedAssets
```

This is the entered death benefit/resource pool used in the Safe Income Coverage analysis.

## 1.5 Coverage Support Rate

```ts
coverageSupportRate = min(1, coverageResources / targetDeathBenefitNeed)
```

The UI shows this as the percentage of the target income support stream backed by the entered resources.

## 1.6 Annual income supported and annual gap

```ts
incomeSupported[year] = min(
  targetIncomeNeed[year],
  targetIncomeNeed[year] × coverageSupportRate
)

incomeGap[year] = max(0, targetIncomeNeed[year] − incomeSupported[year])
```

The chart, Survivor Gap card, and planning narrative are all derived from this same annual schedule.

## 1.7 Survivor Gap

```ts
survivorGap = Σ incomeGap[year]
```

“Fully Covered” is true only when all annual target gaps are zero.

```ts
isFullyCovered = every(incomeGap[year] <= 0)
```

## 1.8 Additional Death Benefit Needed

```ts
additionalDeathBenefitNeeded = max(0, targetDeathBenefitNeed − coverageResources)
```

This replaces the previous misleading behavior where the UI could say fully covered based on a discounted present-value comparison while the advisor-facing need still appeared higher.

## 1.9 PV reference of target need

The module may still calculate a PV reference, but this does not drive the main fully-covered state.

```ts
pvOfTargetNeed = Σ targetIncomeNeed[year] / (1 + roi)^(yearIndex + 1)
```

## 1.10 Coverage Runway Scenario

The previous Max W/D Rate language has been replaced with a Coverage Runway / Asset Return model.

```ts
balance = coverageResources

for each year:
  balance = balance × (1 + maxCoverageRoi)
  maxCovered = min(balance, projectedNetIncomeNeed[year])
  annualGap = max(0, projectedNetIncomeNeed[year] − maxCovered)
  balance = max(0, balance − maxCovered)
```

Outputs:

```ts
yearsOfFullCoverage = count(years where annualGap == 0)
totalIncomeReplaced = Σ maxCovered
survivorGap = Σ annualGap
deathBenefitNeeded = PV(annualGap stream)
```

# 2. Liability / Lawsuit

Primary files:

- `src/features/risk-modules/liability/calculations/calculateLiabilityGap.ts`
- `src/features/risk-modules/liability/components/LiabilityInputForm.tsx`
- `src/features/risk-modules/liability/components/LiabilityOutputView.tsx`
- `src/features/risk-modules/liability/types.ts`

## 2.1 Disposable-income wage garnishment exposure

The Wage Garnishment Risk calculation uses a disposable-income proxy rather than gross income.

Defaults:

```ts
disposableIncomeRatio = 0.65
garnishmentRate = 0.25
incomeGrowthRate = 0.03
```

Annual schedule:

```ts
grossIncome[year] = primaryGrossIncome[year] + spouseGrossIncome[year]
disposableIncome[year] = grossIncome[year] × disposableIncomeRatio
garnishableIncome[year] = disposableIncome[year] × garnishmentRate
```

Cumulative exposure:

```ts
householdWageGarnishmentRisk = Σ garnishableIncome[year]
```

Advisor example:

```ts
$300,000 gross income × 65% = $195,000 disposable income proxy
$195,000 × 25% = $48,750 first-year garnishable exposure
```

Projected from age 41 to 65 at 3% income growth, this produces approximately $1.68M of cumulative wage garnishment exposure.

Disclosure copy should state that this is a simplified disposable-earnings proxy and that actual garnishment rules vary.

## 2.2 At-risk assets

```ts
nonQualifiedAssetsAtRisk = max(
  nonQualifiedAssets,
  investmentAssets + savingsAssets + businessOwnershipValue
)
```

Home equity is entered directly:

```ts
homeEquity = direct input
```

Home value and mortgage balance are no longer part of the active Liability input workflow.

## 2.3 Total household liability exposure

```ts
totalHouseholdLiabilityRisk = householdWageGarnishmentRisk + nonQualifiedAssetsAtRisk
```

Coverage:

```ts
householdTotalCoverage = autoLiabilityLimit + umbrellaCoverage
householdLiabilityGap = max(0, totalHouseholdLiabilityRisk − householdTotalCoverage)
```

## 2.4 Needed umbrella

The UI should not use “Recommended Umbrella.” The advisor-safe label is:

```text
Needed Umbrella
```

Umbrella policies are modeled in $1M blocks.

```ts
coverageGap = max(
  0,
  totalHouseholdLiabilityRisk − autoLiabilityLimit − existingUmbrellaCoverage
)

umbrellaNeeded = coverageGap > 0
  ? ceil(coverageGap / 1_000_000) × 1_000_000
  : 0
```

The four primary metrics are Total Exposure, Total Current Coverage, Coverage Gap, and Needed Umbrella. The description must keep the result illustrative.

# 3. Unemployment

Primary files:

- `src/features/risk-modules/unemployment/calculations/calculateUnemploymentGap.ts`
- `src/features/risk-modules/unemployment/components/UnemploymentInputForm.tsx`
- `src/features/risk-modules/unemployment/components/UnemploymentOutputView.tsx`
- `src/features/risk-modules/unemployment/types.ts`

## 3.1 Net monthly income proxy

```ts
primaryNetMonthlyIncome = primaryAnnualIncome × netIncomeRatio / 12
secondaryNetMonthlyIncome = spouseAnnualIncome × netIncomeRatio / 12
```

Default:

```ts
netIncomeRatio = 0.65
```

## 3.2 Remaining income if highest earner loses income

```ts
incomeAtRisk = max(primaryAnnualIncome, spouseAnnualIncome)
remainingGrossAnnualIncome = min(primaryAnnualIncome, spouseAnnualIncome)
remainingIncome = remainingGrossAnnualIncome × netIncomeRatio / 12
```

Remaining income coverage:

```ts
remainingIncomeCoveragePct = remainingIncome / monthlyExpenses
```

## 3.3 Dynamic ideal reserve months

```ts
if remainingIncomeCoveragePct < 0.33:
  idealReserveMonths = 6
else if remainingIncomeCoveragePct < 0.50:
  idealReserveMonths = 5
else if remainingIncomeCoveragePct < 0.67:
  idealReserveMonths = 4
else:
  idealReserveMonths = 3
```

Minimum reserve months always remains 3.

```ts
monthlyGap = max(0, monthlyExpenses − remainingIncome)
minimumReserveTarget = monthlyGap × 3
idealReserveTarget = monthlyGap × idealReserveMonths
reserveGap = max(0, idealReserveTarget − emergencySavings)
excessReserve = max(0, emergencySavings − idealReserveTarget)
```

Advisor example:

```ts
primaryIncome = $300,000
spouseIncome = $100,000
monthlyExpenses = $20,000
netIncomeRatio = 0.65

remainingIncome = $100,000 × 0.65 / 12 = $5,417
remainingIncomeCoveragePct = $5,417 / $20,000 = 27%
idealReserveMonths = 6
monthlyGap = $20,000 − $5,417 = $14,583
idealReserveTarget = $14,583 × 6 = $87,500
```

## 3.4 Emergency reserve gauge

The gauge is tied to actual emergency savings, not severance or unemployment pools.

```ts
reserveMonthsCurrent = emergencySavings / monthlyGap
reserveGaugeCoveragePct = emergencySavings / idealReserveTarget
```

Severance and unemployment benefits are part of the separate search-period runway model, not the emergency reserve target.

## 3.5 Search-period runway

```ts
monthlyOffset = remainingIncome + severanceMonthly + unemploymentBenefitMonthly
monthlyNetBurn = max(0, monthlyExpenses − monthlyOffset)
```

Month-by-month timeline:

```ts
for each search month:
  offsetIncome = remainingIncome + activeSeverance + activeUnemploymentBenefit
  requiredSavingsDraw = max(0, monthlyExpenses − offsetIncome)
  coveredByReserve = min(reserveBalance, requiredSavingsDraw)
  shortfall = max(0, requiredSavingsDraw − reserveBalance)
  reserveBalance = max(0, reserveBalance − requiredSavingsDraw)
```

Effective runway is displayed as a search-period metric, separate from the emergency reserve gauge.

# 4. Disability

The disability module remains governed by its existing implementation under:

- `src/features/risk-modules/disability/calculations/`
- `src/features/risk-modules/disability/components/`

Core conventions remain:

```ts
ltdMonthlyGross = min(annualIncome × coveragePercent / 12, monthlyCap)
ltdNetMonthly = ltdTaxable ? ltdMonthlyGross × 0.70 : ltdMonthlyGross
totalNetMonthlyBenefit = ltdNetMonthly + privateDiBenefitMonthly
incomeLossNet = annualIncome × 0.70 / 12 − totalNetMonthlyBenefit
```

The advisor-adherence update in this pass targeted Life Insurance, Liability/Lawsuit, and Unemployment.

---

# 5. Copy and compliance framing

Advisor-safe copy is centralized in:

```ts
src/domain/copy/advisorSafeCopy.ts
```

Required framing:

- This is an illustrative gap-analysis tool.
- Avoid “recommended” language for umbrella coverage.
- Use “Needed Umbrella” for the rounded gap and avoid recommendation language.
- Use “Additional Death Benefit Needed” where the module is showing a remaining shortfall after entered resources.
- Explain disposable-income and net-income proxies as simplified assumptions.
